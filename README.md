# Advanced-SQL-Analysis-of-Chicago-Datasets

## Project Overview

This project showcases advanced SQL skills through the analysis of real-life datasets obtained from the City of Chicago's Data Portal. The analysis was performed using three datasets totaling 448KB, which included data on socioeconomic indicators, public schools, and crime statistics. A total of 10 SQL commands were executed to derive meaningful insights regarding crime rates and socioeconomic conditions in various community areas of Chicago.

## Key Insights

1. Calculated the total number of crime incidents documented in the crime database.
2. Identified community areas with a per capita income of less than $11,000, along with their names and numbers.
3. Retrieved case numbers for crimes that involve minors (not including children in this classification).
4. Extracted all reported kidnapping cases involving minors.
5. Determined the types of crimes recorded within school locations, ensuring no repetitions.
6. Presented the different school types alongside their average safety scores.
7. Identified the five community areas with the highest percentages of households living below the poverty line.
8. Identified the most crime-prone community area by displaying only its number.
9. Used a sub-query to find the name of the community area with the highest hardship index.
10. Utilized a sub-query to determine which community area has the highest number of reported crimes.
